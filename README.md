A custom CSS file to streamline across projects

In order to avoid having to copy and paste mostly the same code across many projects over and over again, we collect the global changes we usually apply in our CiviCRM theme here. 
(Shoreditch theme is used across all projects) 
This collection of CSS changes are specific for Drupal and will likely not work in other CMS.

As this file progesses the language might change from CSS to SCSS.
